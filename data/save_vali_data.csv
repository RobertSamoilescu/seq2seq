per his wife.  during his admission at hospital <num>   he was noted to have new jaundice with worsening bilirubinemia/transaminitis; a ruq ultrasound on  <date> showed a distended gallbladder with sludge  mild gb wall thickening  small amounts of pericholecystic fluid  and a mildly prominent cbd.  a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was inserted on  <date> out of concern for cholecystitis.  a follow-up ultrasound showed an increasing amount of abdominal ascites and continued evidence of acalculous cholecystitis (as well as echogenic liver texture with fatty infiltration) and he was transferred to hospital <num>  on  <date> for ercp.  since admission to hospital <num>   he had an ultrasound that showed no evidence of biliary obstruction  cholecystitis  or pancreatitis  small amount of ascites  and a fatty liver. he underwent ercp on [** <num> - <num> **] to rule out biliary obstruction  and this showed biliary sludge which was extracted from the cbd; a sphincterotomy was performed; on cholangiogram  the biliary contour was thought to be consistent with cirrhosis.  he had persistent altered mental status and was started on lactulose for potential hepatic encephalopathy.  autoimmune liver disease serologies were negative  ceruloplasmin normal  his discriminant factor remained below  <num>   hep a  b and c serologies negative.  he had a diagnostic paracentesis [** <num> - <num> **] negative for sbp ( <num>  wbc  <num> % polys).  ua [** <num> - <num> **] had  <num>  wbc few bacteria  trace leukocyte esterase  blood and nitrite negative. cxr on admission showed a possible aspiration pneumonia with extensive opacification in both lungs  primarily upper lobes and hazy opacification at the right lung base.  he was started on levofloxacin/metronidazole on  <date> for a planned  <num> -day course;
